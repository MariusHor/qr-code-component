## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project, although a simple one, was very very helpful in giving me a better understanding of the things that I have learned in the past like css variables
and the importance of having a structured HTML as well as using comments inside the CSS file to make things more clear. I have also realized that I can use the parent 
container to manipulate the size of my images and this was a nice find!

### Continued development

I believe this project helped me understand the use of cards on a website and I plan to continue working on it in order to further improve my skills on this subject,
adding more cards and making them responsive to tablet and desktop sizes.
